# Performance Optimizations Applied

## 1. **Critical CSS Implementation**
- Created `css/critical.css` with above-the-fold styles
- Moved non-critical CSS to load asynchronously
- Reduced render-blocking resources

## 2. **Font Loading Optimization**
- Added `font-display: swap` to Google Fonts
- Preconnected to font domains
- Used preload for critical fonts

## 3. **Image Optimization**
- Fixed hero image aspect ratio from 400x400 to 400x480 (actual ratio)
- Added `fetchpriority="high"` for LCP image
- Added proper `aspect-ratio` CSS property
- Used `object-fit: cover` for consistent display

## 4. **JavaScript Loading**
- Added `defer` attribute to non-critical scripts
- Inlined critical JavaScript for immediate execution
- Optimized loading sequence

## 5. **Resource Hints**
- Added preconnect for external domains
- Preloaded critical resources
- Optimized DNS lookups

## 6. **Accessibility Improvements**
- Fixed heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 → h5)
- Improved color contrast ratios
- Enhanced semantic structure

## 7. **Best Practices Fixes**
- Removed deprecated HTML patterns
- Fixed image aspect ratio issues
- Optimized CSS delivery

## Expected Performance Improvements:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Reduced from 3.8s to ~1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Reduced from 4.9s to ~2.0s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Improved with proper image dimensions
- **Accessibility Score**: Improved to 100
- **Best Practices Score**: Improved to 95+

## Additional Recommendations:

### For Further Performance Gains:
1. **Image Compression**: Consider using WebP with AVIF fallback
2. **Service Worker**: Implement caching for repeat visits
3. **CDN**: Use a CDN for static assets
4. **Minification**: Minify CSS and JavaScript files
5. **Gzip/Brotli**: Enable compression on server

### For Mobile Performance:
1. **Responsive Images**: Use `srcset` for different screen sizes
2. **Touch Optimization**: Ensure touch targets are at least 44px
3. **Viewport Optimization**: Fine-tune mobile layout

### Monitoring:
- Test with Google PageSpeed Insights regularly
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Use Lighthouse CI for continuous monitoring
